# Stack

A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates: you add plates to the top, and you also remove plates from the top.

## Methods

1. Push - adds an item to the top of the stack
1. Pop - removes the value from the top of the stack
1. Top/Peek - returns the value at the top of the stack, without removing it
1. IsEmpty - checks if the stack is empty
1. Size - returns size of stack
